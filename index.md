## Kindra Kanna

### Background

Kindra Kanna is a sea serpent in the shape of a raen Au Ra. Through the use of an Allagan collar, her dragon form can be suppressed.

It was not until she met Midgardsormr that she realized her true dragon nature and the collar's purpose, having been raised by Au Ra her entire life. It was then she discovered that she never sprang from an egg. She was artificially born through Allagan cloning technology. Using DNA from a dead dragon descended from Tiamat's brood, the Allagans made many experimental clones. Each had different alterations, and Kindra's main alteration was her ability to change between dragon and Au Ra form. She has since embraced her Au Ra identity, stubbornly refusing to return to her dragon form around other adventurers. She prefers to keep the Allagan collar on at all times, as it suppresses her dragon form without needing to use up her own aether.

In Azys Lla, the Garleans had discovered one of the last containment units with a living Allagan bioweapon still intact. The Garleans attempted to remove it, intending to use it for themselves in their campaign against Eorzea and Othard. They failed to extract the containment unit, causing it to collapse off of Azys Lla entirely, falling hundreds of yalms into the Ruby Sea. The impact tore open the containment unit, and Kindra woke up for the first time.

Kindra was found and raised by the raen of the Ruby Sea in an exceptional stroke of luck. Unaware of her own origins at first, she grew accustomed to her Au Ra shape and enjoyed her role as a protector and caretaker of Sui-no-Sato for a few years. Some say the "Ruby Dragon" guarding the shrine is purely a mythical sea serpent, however many locals in the area claim to have seen a glimpse of its brilliant red scales glimmering beneath the waves.

After discovering she could change form, Kindra left the village and took the Ruby Sea as her territory under protection. She has made many deals with pirates, destroying many confederate ships which had Captains foolish enough to attack her rather than agree to peaceful terms. She often helps travelers avoid paying the toll, protecting them from Garlean vessels and confederate enforcers alike. Her quiet cave near Sui-no-Sato contains a hoard of gil and cute glamors for her Au Ra form.

Like any dragon, her power is stored within her piercing green eyes. She can willingly bestow this power onto others, or use it to her advantage by surprising opponents with her incredible strength.

When she isn't risking her tail dungeoning or adventuring, she enjoys spending time with friends as a member of the Fates.

### Relationships

Dragons are not "male or female" in the traditional sense. They can adapt their sex based on environmental pressures, similar to many varieties of reptile and fish. Dragons like Kindra go through cycles, Kindra in particular being female most of the time and occasionally male at times.

Kindra's soulmate is Silva, a kind and loving fox spirit blending in with the locals as a Miqo'te. They are inseparable and enjoy spending all of their time together. â™¥

They have a family of many fox kits: Rain (the first), Kimiko (likes to stay in fox form), Camelia and Dhalia (the twins), the octuplets Ichiko, Nimiko, Sanako, Yonako, Gochiko, Rokuko, Nanako, and Hachiko; and more on the way!

Kindra and Silva's close friends Midna and Ai often take care of the kits and help them learn to control their powers.

### Personal Details

In dragon form, Kindra is approximately 22' feet / 7 yalms / 7 meters in length, with a limbless serpentine form, aside from a few mildly flexible fins. She has a bite force of 4,000 psi and swims at speeds in excess of 40 knots. Her ruby scales gleam in the sunlight, matching the reddish-pink color of the water at sunset.

In recent times, she only turns to dragon form when she is out of sight, sleeping in her cave hidden at the bottom of the Ruby Sea.

Even in Au Ra form, she is deceptively strong despite her smallish size. Due to her tendency to go all-out with her full strength, she often loses her tail or a limb while adventuring. Her incredible regeneration powers have her heal and grow limbs back through a lot of rest and consumption of delicious fish.

(Something like this pic just imagine it's more sea serpenty lol)
