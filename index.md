## Kindra Kanna

### Background

Kindra is a serpentine sea dragon in the shape of a raen Au Ra, through the use of an Allagan collar. She woke after her containment unit in Azys Lla fell hundreds of yalms to the ground and tore open. She was found and raised by the raen of the Ruby Sea, in an exceptional stroke of coincidence. Unaware of her own origins at first, she grew accustomed to her Au Ra shape during many years of traveling and self-discovery.

It was not until she met Midgardsormr that she realized her true dragon nature, but she never sprang from a brood, or even an egg. She was artificially born through Allagan cloning technology. She suspects her DNA may be descended from one of Ratatoskr's offspring, but there's no way to know for sure anymore. She accepts this as a sign to embrace her Au Ra identity, and stubbornly refuses to return to her full dragon form around other adventurers. Preferring to keep the Allagan collar on at all times, it is both practical and looks cute.

(In typical fashion, dragons always seem to have at least one thing they're staunchly stubborn about.)

When she isn't risking her tail dungeoning or adventuring, she enjoys spending time with friends and fatemily. :>

### Gender/Sexuality

Dragons do not perceive "male or female" in the traditional sense. Kindra chooses she/her as a preference from growing up with Au Ra people, enjoying her role as a shrine maiden and caretaker during her years living at Sui-no-Sato. Some say the "Ruby Dragon" guarding the shrine is purely a mythical sea serpent, even though many locals in the area claim to have seen a glimpse of it.

### Allagan Mystery

Thanks to Kindra's fascination with translating Allagan technology, she learned that her choker contains information about herself.

After studying the code, Kindra gathers that she is most likely the clone of a long deceased dragon from the third astral era.

While Kindra does not know her own age, she assumes from this information that she is not ancient, but was born relatively recently in that Allagan test tube. The automated system that created her appears to have malfunctioned, or was damaged by experimental intervention.

### Personal Details

In dragon form, Kindra is approximately 22' feet / 7 yalms / 7 meters in length, with a limbless serpentine form, aside from a few mildly flexible fins. She has a bite force of 4,000 psi and swims at speeds in excess of 40 knots. Her ruby scales gleam in the sunlight, matching the reddish-pink color of the water at sunset.

She only turns to dragon form when she is out of sight, sleeping in her cave hidden at the bottom of the Ruby Sea.

Her cave contains a hoard of gold coins, glam gear, and Allagan relics.

When in Au Ra form her mass is still the same, so she is deceptively strong despite her smallish size. Due to her tendency to go all-out with her full strength, she often loses her tail while adventuring, having to grow it back through a lot of rest and consumption of fish.
